# First Layer Adhesion Issues



Before trying the steps below, make sure you have calibrated your live Z correctly. Ignore the Prusa video where Josef says it should be a value of around -1.200. Your value will depend on how far up your PINDA is mounted and how thick your bed plate is. Your live Z value is adjusted properly when the lines of plastic that are laid down do not have any gaps in between them. If you think your live Z is adjusted properly, you may begin the following steps: 
1) Clean your bed plate with (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005DNQX3C/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apap_2tu8Mct2ObEU7)[99.9% Isopropyl alcohol] and UNSCENTED paper towels. Do not use anything less than 99.9% and do not rub it in a circular motion, rather, rub it from side to side. Your bed plate has oils on it (from the manufacturing process, and from whenever you touch it with your oily hands) and your goal is getting the oil off, not spreading it around. It's very important to also use unscented paper towels with no coloring designs as these may have oils in them.  
2) If the isopropyl alcohol fails to help, use unscented dish soap and hot water to clean your bed plate in the sink. Scrub it well, and dry with unscented paper towels. Be sure to not touch the clean bed plate with your hands once washed (grip the edges only). Soap breaks down grease and oils even better than Isopropyl alcohol, but is obviously a more annoying process. If you don't touch your bed plate too much, you should be fine with washing your plate in the sink once per month, and rubbing it with isopropyl alcohol once a day before your first print of the day. 
3) If you are still having issues, try printing your first layer hotter. Hotter plastic is more "liquidy" and will spread on the bed easier, as well as stick better. I personally use 220c for PLA and 265c for PETG first layers. 
4) Make sure fan is disabled for first layer in slic3r. You might even want to disable it for the first 2 or 3 layers for a smaller prints, as your plastic being laid down might be cooling too quickly for it to stick. 
5) Try a warmer bed temperature. I personally find that my bed is actually 5c colder than the printer reports. So I print with my bed temp at 65c for PLA instead of the default of 60c. 
6) If you are using a smooth PEI sheet, rough it up gently with a scotchbrite pad or fine grit sandpaper. It won't affect your print quality and the rough surface will create more friction for the hot plastic to stick to. 
7) If all else fails, buy a powder coated sheet. You can get an aftermarket one on Amazon called "thekkiinngg v3" for $60. It's a bit pricey, but PLA sticks amazingly well to this sheet,  and I love the textured finish it gives my prints. Once Prusa begins selling their own powder coated sheets again, they will be a better option.
